## To-do


2. Take the k nn and make a distribution to get stochastic regen
    - The yai objects have the distances and nearest neighbors. 
    - yai$neiDstTrgs is a matrix of distances between a target and the k references. 
    - Pick from those nn to get stochastic regen.

3. Try to find the probability of regen in the RF tool, it may be from a different model.
    - I must have been thinking of something else. I cannot find the probability. 

There could be something in the idea of making a probablity out of the distribution 
of nearest references that have regeneration. Say, if there were 10 NN and one had 
regen, but the others didn't, it would be a ten percent chance of regen. 
Then recompute the yai distances for the stands with regen, but only include 
stands with seedlings. 



5. Can FPAG be a predictor in RF, it didnâ€™t work in MSN. If so also try ecoregion.
6. Check on using Climate water deficit?
    - Find the data, consider the possibilities, and try to use it.
8. Create some visualizations for seedling density by predictor.

done:

1. Make the FPAGs 3 digits, removing some specificity
    - At least in CDS6 vs CDS, it didn't help much. 
    
4. Add more data from eco-regions in the state and maybe further afield.
    - It doubled the number of plots available, but I only tested CDS
    - In both sets, about half the plots didn't have seedlings. 
    - **It may be time to test more FPAGs.** 
   
 
I am set up in the imputation page to try adding FPAG as a predictor in RF. 
If I can use categorical in RF, PHYSCLCD would probably be a good one. to try. 

2. The knn distribution is in the
